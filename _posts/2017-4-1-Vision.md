# Grab a Bike-Project vision

Grab a bike is a effort-free bike sharing that focuses on the environment and on the user, providing hop and go feeling and an intelligent navigation through the city.

In most cities public transport, despite the efforts, isn’t good enough, and the already existing bike sharing services force you to leave the bike in a given spot after the ride, which ends up to being uncomfortable if you are in a hurry. Plus when you get on the bike you have no information about the path you should follow and if you don’t know the city very well you could end up stuck in some over-polluted place which would make your ride a very undesirable experience.
  
Nevertheless bike sharing is still a good idea for both the environment and our wallets, so that’s where Grab a Bike comes in: our goal is to offer a new generation bike sharing service, allowing you to look up on your phone the position of the closest bike, enjoy your ride and leave it wherever you want, being provided with information if you are entering a polluted or busy zone during your ride.


## Open issues

From the very first moment we understood that securing our bikes would have been a primary issue in our project. We are aware that securing a bike perfectly is impossible but we try to make stealing one of our bikes as hard as possible. First of all a smart lock is connected to each bike, allowing the user to secure it to almost everything. The lock can be opened by means of the smartphone app and once closed if it’s severed it lets us know what is going on and triggers the built in position tracker of the bike recording the whole route the bike follows while a loud siren lets the whole neighborhood know what you are doing, so, if you really want to steal a bike, it might not be a great idea to steal ours.

## Main AmI steps

1. Sensing: The system senses if the air is polluted or the zone you are entering is too busy or if someone is trying to steal the bike.
 
2. Reasoning: On the base of what is senses the system can suggest you to change your path
 
3. Acting: A security system triggers whenever the bike is being stolen.
 
4. Interacting: The system interacts with the user giving him information and also with the manager, letting him know if a bike is being stolen.
 
## AmI features
 
1. Grab a Bike is sensitive and responsive: it can sense environmental pollution and suggest you to change your path. Moreover it interacts with you by means of the application.
 
2. Grab a Bike is ubiquitous: many bikes can be scattered through the whole town allowing you to just look for the closest one.
 
3. Grab a Bike is intelligent: it detects when you’re too close to a polluted or busy area, it warns you if it’s being stolen.
