# Grab a Bike-Project vision

Nowadays in Italy driving across a large city can be very stressing and the price for gasoline and parking fees is very high. Moreover in many cities for the sake of the environment car blocks are becoming more and more frequent. For these and many other reasons moving around by car is no longer that convenient, specially for short runs. 
  
Unluckily in most cities public transport, despite the efforts, isn’t good enough, and the already existing bike sharing services force you to leave the bike in a given spot after the ride, which ends up to being uncomfortable and if you are in a hurry. Furthermore when you get on the bike you have no information about the path you should follow and if you don’t know the city very well you could end up stuck in some over-polluted place which would make your ride a very undesirable experience.
  
Nevertheless bike sharing is still a good idea for both the environment and our wallets, so that’s where Grab a Bike comes in: our goal is to offer a new generation bike sharing service, allowing you to look up on your phone the position of the closest bike, enjoy your ride and leave it wherever you want, being with information if you are entering a polluted or busy zone during your ride.

From the very first moment we understood that securing our bikes would have been a primary issue in our project. We are aware that securing a bike perfectly is an impossible idea but we try to make stealing one of our bikes as hard as possible. First of all a smart lock is connected to each bike, allowing the user to secure it to secure it to almost everything. The lock could be opened by means of the smartphone app and once closed if it’s severed it sends us a notification and triggers the built in position tracker of the bike recording the whole route the bike follows and a loud siren, making the whole neighborhood know what you are doing, so, if you really want to steal a bike, it might not be a great idea to steal ours.
