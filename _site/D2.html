<h2 id="purpose-and-scope">PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h2>
<p>Grab a bike is an effort-free bike sharing service that focuses on the environment and user, providing hop and go feeling and an intelligent navigation through the city. 
The system is designed to provide a service free from all the constraints of specific parking spots: the bike can be taken and left wherever the user needs. 
Moreover, with a smart pollution monitoring system, grab-a-bike can prevent the user from passing through polluted spots in the city.</p>

<h2 id="definitions">DEFINITIONS</h2>
<h3 id="glossary">Glossary</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>App</strong>: Android based application (4.4+).</li>
  <li><strong>The interface</strong>: the application.</li>
  <li><strong>HW</strong>: the hardware part fixed on the bike crossbar.</li>
  <li><strong>The sensor</strong>: the pollution sensor provided on the HW part.</li>
  <li><strong>The lock</strong>: the lock managed by the HW and the app.</li>
  <li><strong>LEDS</strong>: the LEDs fixed on the handle of the bike to provide the routing advice.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="actors">Actors</h3>

<p>Every adult citizen who has a smartphone with GPS and Internet connection, such as travelers, workers and students.</p>

<p><strong>1.1 User registration</strong> - 
<strong>Priority:1</strong>
The user registration on the website is needed to control the bikes’ access.</p>

<p><strong>1.2 User auto-login manual-logout</strong> - 
<strong>Priority: 2</strong>
The user will only need to login once on the app, the next time the interface will be acceded without a login. The logout will have to be done manually.
The latest position of the bike is stored on a database. Once the bike is unlocked and locked again the position will be updated.</p>

<p><strong>3.1.1 Pollution database</strong> - 
<strong>Priority : 2</strong></p>

<p>A database stores data about the pollution level as a function of the position. If the database has already pollution information of a certain place, the data is updated whenever a new value is detected. If the pollution level is greater than a given limit level, a flag is given to the user.</p>

<p><strong>3.1.2 Sensing</strong> - 
<strong>Priority : 1</strong>
The pollution data is provided by a sensor embedded in the onboard system of the bike.</p>

<p><strong>3.2. Position</strong> - 
<strong>Priority : 2</strong>
The GPS data is given by the GPS antenna of the user’s smartphone.</p>

<p><strong>4.1 Anti-pollution Advice by means of a LED</strong> - 
<strong>Priority: 2</strong>
During the use of the bike, if the user position is close to a polluted place (pollution flag = 1) the notification LED turns on.</p>

<p><strong>4.2 Anti-pollution advice - notification</strong> - 
<strong>Priority: 3</strong></p>

<p>During the use of the bike, if the user position is close to a polluted place (pollution flag = 1) the app sends a notification to the user.</p>

<p><strong>5.1 Smart lock</strong> - 
<strong>Priority: 1</strong>
The bike is provided with an automatic lock, controlled by the user via the application.</p>

<p><strong>5.2 Smart alarm</strong> - 
<strong>Priority: 2</strong>
When the bike is locked, if it is moved the alarm is activated.</p>

<h2 id="non-functional-requirements">NON FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Portability: Android smartphones running KitKat or later (4.4+)</li>
  <li>Efficiency: The response time for the system to detect the polluted area and warn the user of an alternative route is estimated to be a couple seconds maximum, this way the user experience won’t be compromised.</li>
  <li>Privacy: User data is logged in the server anonymously, saving only the bike positions and the polluted areas.</li>
  <li>Safety: The user ride through the city won’t be distracted with the smartphone screen, only a small screen/led on the bike will provide relevant information to the user.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="open-issues">OPEN ISSUES</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Bike connection to the Internet</li>
  <li>Bike theft detection and prevention</li>
